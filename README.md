## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

## What I learned

What I need to learn is to pay closer attention to the designs including the active states. Otherwise I am getting continuesly surprised by elements I did not consider during the sketch phase. That makes late additions like for example the tooltips in this specific case rather difficult and nerve wrecking.

Other than that I am very happy how this project went rather smoothly from start to finish and I can feel the improvements I have made up until now. Especially with flexbox I feel confident and usually secure in what to do to archieve expected results. With Javascript it is similar but slower, since I've just started using and understanding it.

I hope this solution helps someone who is looking to learn HTML, CSS and JS as well. I tried to make it understandable for others and myself.
